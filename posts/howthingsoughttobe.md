  Dee Hock puts forth a highly compelling vision for the mankind in "One from
  many", a story of how Visa came to be. But more importantly it is a beautiful,
  almost poem-like, description of how he experiences the universe. Hock
  highlights the fatal flaws of the machine metaphor we find ourselves trapped
  in and describes one alternative way of being and seeing. How things ought to

Dee Hock puts forth a highly compelling vision for the mankind and people in organisations in his book "One from many", a story of how Visa came to be. But more importantly it is a beautiful, almost poem-like, description of how he experiences the universe. Hock highlights the fatal flaws of the machine metaphor we find ourselves trapped in and describes an alternative way of being and seeing. How things ought to be, one of Hock's main questions, gets an answer in this book that is surely getting either labeled as New Age mumbojumbo or extremely wise and compelling.

The main tenet of this book to me is there's a glaring mismatch between the metaphor collectively employed by most westerners and the way nature functions in reality. The internal model of reality that most of us have builds on the machine age, where everything can be measured, predicted, and broken down into smaller pieces, fragments. Tick, tock, tick, tock. The machine age has put us in a mental cage making us think and see things as if everything's a machine and maybe even more importantly, separating us from the Earth. As if we, the mankind are masters of the universe, separate from the nature. It has given us worse and worse distribution of wealth, a dying planet and wide social issues. The alternative then is according to Hock to see things through the chaordic lens: not quite chaos, not quite order. Emergent. Everything's interconnected and whole. Just like nature.

The book is also an excellent description of the chaordic organisations in the [Marshall model](https://flowchainsensei.wordpress.com/rightshifting/the-marshall-model/), the most effective collective mindset of organisations. Couldn't be further from the analytical organisations and this book makes the difference extremely obvious.

Some highlights from the book (Some paraphrasing mixed with my own thoughts. Deal with it.) :

> To command and control is to rob self and others the joys of living. Life is not about control, no matter how much we feel uncomfort when faced with uncertainty.
>
> In analytical organisations, procedure is more important than purpose, and method more important than results.
>
> The industrial age became the age of the managers. Experts at controlling, reducing variability, driving uncertainty out. Experts at creating and maintaining efficiency. Trapped in the old paradigms of predictability and control, they want to know how things will end before they begin.
>
> Lead yourself, lead your superiors, lead your peers, employ good people and free them to do the same. All else is trivia!
>
> Human ingenuity is the most underutilized and constantly abused resource in the world. The source of that abuse is mechanistic, industrial age, dominator organisations and the management practices they spawn.
>
> People are entire human beings containing the whole of evolving universe. They are not things to be manipulated. Not human resources. 
>
> Leadership by everyone; leadership in, up, around, and down.
>
> Understanding events and influencing the future requires mastering of four ways of looking at things; as they were, as they are, as they might become, and as they ought to be. Ought, as in preferred and ethically better condition.
>
> Possibility can never be determined by opinion, only by attempt.
>
> Leaders educe behaviours, not compel.

There's simply too many to mention, definitely a book to revisit!
