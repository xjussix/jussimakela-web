summary: >-
  People seem to be experts at having arguments and defending their views, be it
  in their relationships or in their workplaces. More often than not it seems
  (to me at least) that we're [talking past each
  other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_past_each_other). In the best
  case we might get over that hurdle but end up in the next: We can't agree on
  the definitions. I suppose words by design are "fluffy" and ambiguous making
  it difficult to communicate in a precise manner. Add to that all the biases
  and filtering that automatically takes place and we have a proper mess in our
  hands. Question still remains, how can we ever agree on anything if we can't
  agree on what the words mean? How can we ever explain anything, not to mention
  drawany rational conclusions if we don't define the words we use?

People seem to be experts at having arguments and defending their views, be it in their relationships or in their workplaces. More often than not it seems (to me at least) that we're [talking past each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_past_each_other). In the best case we might get over that hurdle but end up in the next: We can't agree on the definitions. I suppose words by design are "fluffy" and ambiguous making it difficult to communicate in a precise manner. Add to that all the biases and filtering that automatically takes place and we have a proper mess in our hands. Question still remains, how can we ever agree on anything if we can't agree on what the words mean? How can we ever explain anything, not to mention drawany rational conclusions if we don't define the words we use?

Organisations, management literature, services sold by consultancies and the professions themselves are an extremely good example of this. Here's just a list of some of the most ambiguous words being thrown around carelessly pretty much on a daily basis, in no particular order:

* Value

  * I think this is my favourite. Have you ever tried asking someone to define what exactly they mean by value? No? You should. Preferably ask many different people to get a better picture of how unclear it essentially is.
* Quality

  * Uh-oh. Not the Q-word. The most recent comment about defining quality I heard was "Let's not go there, it's impossible". 
* Flow

  * So, do you mean the psychological state of focus? Or maybe you are one of those touting the ideas from Lean? Flow of what?
* DevOps

  * DevOps is our ops team. No it's a philosophy. No it's a toolchain. No it's how you develop software. No it's Microsoft's platform.
* Agile

  * I don't know if we even need to go here, the mother of all minefields. Do you mean the different software development methodologies losely related and hanging under the same umbrella? Is Scrum Agile? Big A or small a? Or do you mean post-its, pointless ceremonies (urgh) and hugs? Or do you mean processes? Or maybe you've read the terribly titled book about doing twice the work in half the time, yes lets buy some of that. Agile HR, give me a break. No wait, maybe you mean the certificates, that must be it! 
  * Whatever the definition, it's pretty much never the definition of the adjective 'agile'. Seems to be the opposite of "graceful, nimble".
* Iterative

  * Even the "Agile Manifesto" signatories have differing definitions of this one. Very helpful, seeing that you stand for something described as "iterative and incremental".
* Value stream

  * First of all, did you define the word value? No? Good luck.
* Productivity

  * Lines of code per day? Hours sat in front of the code editor? Number of units produced? What if they are wrong or faulty units? Effective vs efficient? Less wait time, but for who/what?
* Outcome

  * "Outcome over output". Impact. Effect. Objective. Key result. Goal. Arey they synonyms? Also, whose outcome? Or to put it in Ackoff's way: means and ends are relative. Somebody's end can be somebody else's means.
* Prioritisation

  * Do you mean you've ordered a list from the most important to the least important? Or do you mean the prioritised things need immediate attention? Or?
* Design

  * Service Design. UX Design. What the source code ended up becoming. What a thing looks like. How things are laid out. I'm going nuts here.
* Product

  * Oh this is a fun one. Ask your "product" "owner". (Did you see what I did there? :D)
* Product development

  * Given that you have understood what a product is, what do we then mean by product development? What is the purpose of it? How would you identify effective product development?
* Customer

  * The mythical customer. Customer-centric. Customer first. Customer obsession. What kind of customer is that?
* Requirement

  * Description of a solution seems to be typical. Maybe "as a user I want to log in so that I can use the system". No? How about a list of any and all functions the software we want to cram into the system? No? What is it that a requirement describes then? Are you sure it's "required" as the name implies? How so?

My hats off to you if you, dear reader, managed somehow to read this far. As per the "thou shalt either give practical advice or end with a question as a blog author" rule book states, here's a suggestion. Next time you hear someone use words like above, ask them: "So what kind of X is that X?". Maybe you can at least understand their point of view slightly better. Although in my experience it seems only to get me in trouble and get me labeled as a pain in the ass. Oh well, damned if you do, damned if you don't.

P.S. Also, why on Earth doesn't anybody seem to care about defining things?

Yours truly,

Pain-in-the-butt
