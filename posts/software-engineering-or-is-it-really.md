summary: During my two decades in the software industry I've seen a whole bunch
  of different words used to describe us IT people. Coders, programmers,
  hackers, developers, you name it. The most recent one that seems to be on the
  rise is the engineer. We have software engineers, release train engineers,
  engineering managers and the list goes on. Call me nitpicky, but if there's
  something I've learned during the past few years is we need to actually pay
  attention to the words we use and what we mean, so what exactly does
  engineering mean and call for?

During my two decades in the software industry I've seen a whole bunch of different words used to describe us IT people. Coders, programmers, hackers, developers, you name it. The most recent one that seems to be on the rise is the engineer. We have software engineers, release train engineers, engineering managers and the list goes on. Call me nitpicky, but if there's something I've learned during the past few years is we need to actually pay attention to the words we use and what we mean, so what exactly does engineering mean and call for?

As usual, if you only take the time to look you will find smart people most likely already have pinned things down and so is the case even for engineering. No wonder maybe as engineering has a very long history, just see for yourself how Billy Vaughn Koen writes about the engineering method:

> \
> The use of the engineering method rather than the use of reason is humankind's most equitably divided endowment. I mean by

> the engineering method the strategy for causing the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources
>
>

> and by reason, the ability to distinguish between the true and the false, or what Descartes has called "good sense." Whereas reason had to await early Greek philosophy for its development, is even now denied in some cultures, and is in retreat in others, the underlying strategy that defines the engineering method has not changed since the birth of humans. To be human is to be an engineer. \[1]

\
One could simplify and say engineering is an approach to problem solving that has specific characteristics. An engineer would then be a person applying the engineering method. In order for the engineering method to be applicable, Koen suggests we need to understand the four words in the definition more thoroughly: Change, Resources, Best, Uncertainty. \[2]

Does the situation call for a change? Whilst this might be a very obvious one at first pass, it has some very critical aspects to it. If the point of engineering is to cause a change from A to B, do we have the perfect knowledge about the world whilst we're still in point A? What about point B, are we perfectly certain about what the world looks like when we get to B? Probably not. This then, leads to the third question: Given that we don't have perfect information, how do we know how to get to B? Koen formulates this very clearly as *"Usually a number of alternatives exist, each limited by different constraints. The engineer is not responsible for implementing a single change, but for choosing the most appropriate one."* \[3]

Lastly, unless the time needed for causing the change isn't significant, B has a nasty tendency of moving about whether we like it or not. So how do we go about choosing the best strategy to get to B when it's a moving target? How do we avoid painting ourselves into the corner and keep our options open as long as needed?

Now, had we an infinite amount of resources, we wouldn't have to worry about any of this. For most of us this is quite far from reality though and thus we have to keep a very close eye on the constraints. As with the previous point about change however, we tend to have a too simplistic view of resources. According to Koen's definition, *"an engineering resource is anything that makes an important or significant difference to a project"* \[4]. So, besides time and money that are the most obvious resources, have you considered other factors such as available space, political capital, equipment, capacity, weight, ability, enthusiasm, or anything else that might be relevant in your context? Another, often completely neglected aspect when evaluating resources is how efficiently they are used \[5]. Allocating your available resources in a smart way might actually increase the amount of available resources by converting from a resource type to another. Why is this important? If the allocation of resources is kept static with no or little flexibility we are effectively impacting the available options we have thus limiting the effectiveness of the design.

What is buried inside the word "best"? This surprisingly innocent looking word leads to a deep, philosophical discussion that I'll leave to the reader to investigate, but suffice to say no matter who the engineer is, we are working with approximations of what the real, absolute, ultimate "best" looks like. A more technical synonym here as pointed out by Koen would be "optimum". \[6] But optimal according to what or who? What constitutes the optimization space? What are we leaving out? This then eventually leads to the fact we are even here working with incomplete information, so the engineering method needs to be able to cope with that.

Lastly, uncertainty. If it didn't already become clear, uncertainty and lack of information is an inherent property of problems requiring an engineering approach. So far there doesn't seem to be better approaches out there, so we might as well all become fluent engineers.

So what does this all have to do with software development or IT in general? Well, have you ever seen a development project where the previous four criteria didn't apply? I would challenge you dear reader and say the answer is no. How is it then, that the use of the engineering method is largely missing in action within the software development community, no matter the role or expertise? And just by suddenly adding the name "engineer" in our titles, does that actually make us engineers or knowledgeable in engineering? I doubt that.

How do we DO approach things instead very very commonly? Let me quote my friend Marcus Kempe who so eloquently describes what reality looks like for most of us. 

> \[But] software development is not a matter of processing defined, decided, abstracted, and objective information through developers, like if it was a matter of refining raw material through production lines consisting of different kinds of machinery in a factory. It is this, to a large extent, unconscious assumption that creates a lot of friction in our organizations today. Software (or product) development is too uncertain to be approached in this way; the inner nature of it will resist the mechanistic cage we are trying to confine it in. \[7]

Agile software development has become a very popular approach but even when done well doesn’t really take us much closer to a real engineering approach. It certainly might help us become more effective, relative speaking, but as typically “implemented”, it’s just a camouflage over the same old, rigid, mechanistic processes we’ve always suffered from.

There are some exceptions to the rule of course. Most vocal proponent of the engineering approach within IT that I'm aware of is Tom Gilb who I have the honour of calling a friend and a mentor these days. As per Gilb's definition, *"the primary systems engineering task is to design and deliver the best technical and organizational solutions, in order to satisfy the stakeholders' requirements, at a competitive cost"*. \[8] Now does that remind you of something? Unfortunately, despite multiple decades of him promoting systems engineering the awareness in the IT community amongst the technical experts and management is low to put it mildly.

Maybe it is due to the relative young age of the software development profession, but there's a very long road ahead of us still at this rate until the IT community takes the engineering approach as a given the way it is done in other fields. That is the real mindset shift that is sorely needed taking us to a more harmonious state where we are in phase with the work. I believe this needs to be approached from multiple angles, but the educational systems certainly play a major role. It is not enough to teach techniques in engineering schools. Techniques and technologies are secondary that come and go, but how to solve problems the way an engineer does is where the game is at.

I truly hope you, dear reader, will find this interesting and have the curiosity to start thinking more like an engineer whenever the situation so requires. To your surprise, it might apply to more situations than you would imagine. :)
